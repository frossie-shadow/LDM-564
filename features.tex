\section{Functionality in future DM releases}
\label{sect:features}

This is currently not an exhaustive feature list but gives an indication at a high level of the features in each release which will be verified by the corresponding verification test campaign.
As the test plans are written this will become a list of requirements to be tested for that release and thus begin o fill out the verification control database (currently to be in Jira).

In the feature lists below the internal milestone for that feature is given in parenthesis)


Each section here is a test milestone from \citeds{LDM-503} - the same labels are used. The timeline is in the DM schedule using the same labels and depicted in \figref{fig:schedule}
